# HAHAFUNNYCODE


## Intro
Inspired by LOLCODE, HAHAFUNNYCODE, officially shortened to HHFCode (pronounced Hifcode), aims to improve upon the style that was proposed by LOLCODE.

## Hello World

    I AM boss
    LOOK! "HI HI lol"
    WAS I GUD PROGRAM?

## Comments

    :D for single line comments

    <3
    for multiline comments
    <3

## Formatting

### Whitespace

### Code Lines



## Variables

### Declaration and Assignment

    IS THAT <var name>?
    <var name> NOW <expression> LOL

    :D Shortened to
    IS THAT <var name> A <expression>?

### Types
**Need names for types**
* int ->
* float ->
* string ->
* boolean ->
* Undefined ->
* Type ->


### Containers
* Array/List ->
* Map ->
* Set? ->

## Operators

### Math
* addition: AND
* subtraction: WITHOUT
* multiplication: TOGETHER
* divide: GROUPED
* modulo: MUCH LEFT
* increment: UPUP
* decrement: DOWNDOWN

### Boolean
* `==` -> IS
* `!=` -> N'IS
* `<` &nbsp;&nbsp;-> MORE SMOL
* `>` &nbsp;&nbsp;-> MORE HUGE
* `<=` -> SMOLISH
* `>=` -> HUGERISH


## Flow-Control

### Conditionals
If/Else:

    HMM <expression> ? :D If
        <code>
    BRUH :D Else
        <code>
    HMMK

If/Else if/Else

    HMM <expression> ?
        <code>
    UNLESS <expression> ?
        <code>
    BRUH
        <code>
    HMMK

### Combining boolean expressions

* and -> ALSO
* or -> INSTEAD HMM :D dunno
* not -> UNO REVERSE :D too long?
* xor -> ?

### Loops

    LOOP [WITH <var> go <UPUP/DOWNDOWN>] TIL <expression>
        <body>


## Functions

### Defining

For functions that do not return anything:

    I CAN <function> USING (<arg1>,<arg2>...) BY:
        <body>

For functions that return something:

    I CAN GET <function> USING (<arg1>,<arg2>...) BY:
        <body>

### Calling

For functions with no return (procedures):

    I DO <function> WITH (<arg1>,<arg2>...)

For functions that return variables:

    for (<var1>, <var2>...) I GET <function> WITH (<arg1>,<arg2>...)

### Built-in functions
- Max -> Biggest(numbers) returns number
- Min -> Smolest(numbers) returns number
- Avg -> Middlest(numbers) returns number
- Random number -> Surprise(low number, high number) returns number
- Length -> bigness
- More to come


## Stuff to decide

1. How to handle declaration with functions as expression
2. Type and container names  
3. How to index container
